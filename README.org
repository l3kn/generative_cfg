* Python Generative Art with Context-Free Grammars
Framework for exploring (graphical) interpretations of context free
grammars (CFGs).

[[https://www.leonrische.me/pages/images/generative_art_with_cfgs/flower4_03.svg]]

For an introduction into the theory behind CFGs and a few usage
examples, see [[https://www.leonrische.me/pages/generative_art_with_cfgs.html][Generative Art with Context-Free Grammars]].

Main concepts:

- Grammar :: A collection of terminals, non-terminals and production rules. Terminals
             are implemented as anonymous functions, non-terminals as strings.
- State :: An object that is passed to each of the (~lambda~)
           terminals. A graphics turtle "state" is included.
- Backend :: Implements conversion form a *state* to some output
             format. A backend for generating =.svg= images is included.
* Getting Started
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/l3kn/generative_cfg
cd generative_cfg
python setup.py install
#+END_SRC

Then the library can be imported using ~import generative_cfg~.

An easy way to get started is to modify and extend one of the example
files in =examples/=.
