* Context Free
Small python frame for exploring (graphical) interpretations of context
free grammars (CFGs).

For an introduction into the theory behind CFGs and a few usage
examples, see (TODO, link post).
** Concepts
There are three main concepts
*** Grammar
A grammar has terminals and non-terminals. In this framework,
terminals are implemented as anonymous functions, non-terminals as
strings references.
*** State
The state is some object that is passed to each of the (~lambda~)
terminals. For now, only one kind of state is included, a graphics turtle.

TODO List turtle graphics operations
*** Backend
Backends can be used to support different output formats for one (or
different) kinds of state.

Two backends are included, one for generating ~.svg~ images and one
for generating a image description format I'm using in my personal
plotting setup (TODO: Link Plotter/driver).
